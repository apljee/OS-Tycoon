Austin's Work Ideas:

OS Computer Tycoon:

The Player begins in the Early Eighties, Where computer gaming, and other factors such as new OSes by Nanosoft, and it's competiting manufacturer, Pear, have
recently been released. The player gets a spark in his/her head, and decides that he/she should make his/her own OS. Game begins.

Nanosoft is steadily making more sales than Pear, but Pear is selling for more, so they make a bigger profit. For the first 5 years of the game, like Resinex
stated, players will have to use newspapers until the internet is released for PUBLIC use. Players will be able to customize logos, startbar colours, and
even the background screen of the OS. Players will have the option to "overclock" an OS, and work on extra compatability on it. While players develop OS,
they can also hire more people, and pay attention to the outside world. If an OS is not selling, a player will have to pick from one of the three avalible
jobs in order to gain some more pocket cash:

Fry Cook,
Pizza Delivery,
Newspaper Route

Remeber! OS Development costs money! Players will not be able to develop OS's for free. However, there will be upgrades to player's stats that players can do
such as Coding School, Software Development Courses, and even in the future, being able to purchase a Dog that is trained to code. (I know, I just want some
humor in the game.) Players will also be able to purchase programs to work on their OS's more effectively.


EG;

Player purchases E-Z OS for $20
Productivity Increased!
OS Stats:
Design: 21 --- > 26
Technology: 15 --- > 19
Customization: 9 --- > 12
Built-in Programs: 13 --- > 15
Bugs: 19 --- > 14


Those are 20 minutes worth of ideas.
